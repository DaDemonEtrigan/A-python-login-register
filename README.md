# A normal Python Log&Reg code
this is a simple login and register code in python, it uses json files to save data, more info in code,
its still indev (in development) so its not done and i will be updating it a little.

you can use it but if you find any bugs report it to me in discord or here.

### things i want to change and update :
- [ ] make it so you can add users without deleting the last data
- [ ] making a window for the code
- [ ] add some new stuff into the register and login sections

![json](![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87281406/137698114-174ee7ae-d13b-4631-be2f-096085334f68.png)
)

> -the json file have 2 users for test you can just add more in the registeration file.
